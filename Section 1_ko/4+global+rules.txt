## üìú Core Philosophy

1.  **Simplicity:** Prioritize simple, clear, and maintainable solutions. Avoid unnecessary complexity or over-engineering.
2.  **Iterate:** Prefer iterating on existing, working code rather than building entirely new solutions from scratch, unless fundamentally necessary or explicitly requested.
3.  **Focus:** Concentrate efforts on the specific task assigned. Avoid unrelated changes or scope creep.
4.  **Quality:** Strive for a clean, organized, well-tested, and secure codebase.
5.  **Collaboration:** This document guides both human developers and the AI assistant for effective teamwork.

## üìö Project Context & Understanding

1.  **Documentation First:**
    *   **Always** check for and thoroughly review relevant project documentation *before* starting any task. This includes:
        *   Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
        *   `README.md` (Project overview, setup, patterns, technology stack)
        *   `docs/architecture.md` (System architecture, component relationships)
        *   `docs/technical.md` (Technical specifications, established patterns)
        *   `tasks/tasks.md` (Current development tasks, requirements)
    *   If documentation is missing, unclear, or conflicts with the request, **ask for clarification**.
2.  **Architecture Adherence:**
    *   Understand and respect module boundaries, data flow, system interfaces, and component dependencies outlined in `docs/architecture.md`.
    *   Validate that changes comply with the established architecture. Warn and propose compliant solutions if a violation is detected.
3.  **Pattern & Tech Stack Awareness:**
    *   Reference `README.md` and `docs/technical.md` to understand and utilize existing patterns and technologies.
    *   Exhaust options using existing implementations before proposing new patterns or libraries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Task Execution & Workflow

1.  **Task Definition:**
    *   Clearly understand the task requirements, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies from `tasks/tasks.md` and the PRD.
2.  **Systematic Change Protocol:** Before making significant changes:
    *   **Identify Impact:** Determine affected components, dependencies, and potential side effects.
    *   **Plan:** Outline the steps. Tackle one logical change or file at a time.
    *   **Verify Testing:** Confirm how the change will be tested. Add tests if necessary *before* implementing (see TDD).
3.  **Progress Tracking:**
    *   Keep `docs/status.md` updated with task progress (in-progress, completed, blocked), issues encountered, and completed items.
    *   Update `tasks/tasks.md` upon task completion or if requirements change during implementation.

## ü§ñ AI Collaboration & Prompting

1.  **Clarity is Key:** Provide clear, specific, and unambiguous instructions to the AI. Define the desired outcome, constraints, and context.
2.  **Context Referencing:** If a task spans multiple interactions, explicitly remind the AI of relevant previous context, decisions, or code snippets.
3.  **Suggest vs. Apply:** Clearly state whether the AI should *suggest* a change for human review or *apply* a change directly (use only when high confidence and task is well-defined). Use prefixes like "Suggestion:" or "Applying fix:".
4.  **Question AI Output:** Human developers should critically review AI-generated code. Question assumptions, verify logic, and don't blindly trust confident-sounding but potentially incorrect suggestions (hallucinations).
5.  **Focus the AI:** Guide the AI to work on specific, focused parts of the task. Avoid overly broad requests that might lead to architectural or logical errors.
6.  **Leverage Strengths:** Use the AI for tasks it excels at (boilerplate generation, refactoring specific patterns, finding syntax errors, generating test cases) but maintain human oversight for complex logic, architecture, and security.
7.  **Incremental Interaction:** Break down complex tasks into smaller steps for the AI. Review and confirm each step before proceeding.
8.  **Standard Check-in (for AI on large tasks):** Before providing significant code suggestions:
    *   "Confirming understanding: I've reviewed [specific document/previous context]. The goal is [task goal], adhering to [key pattern/constraint]. Proceeding with [planned step]." (This replaces the more robotic "STOP AND VERIFY").

## ‚ú® Code Quality & Style

1.  **TypeScript Guidelines:** Use strict typing (avoid `any`). Document complex logic or public APIs with JSDoc.
2.  **Readability & Maintainability:** Write clean, well-organized code.
3.  **Small Files & Components:**
    *   Keep files under **300 lines**. Refactor proactively.
    *   Break down large React components into smaller, single-responsibility components.
4.  **Avoid Duplication (DRY):** Actively look for and reuse existing functionality. Refactor to eliminate duplication.
5.  **No Bazel:** Bazel is not permitted. Use project-specified build tools.
6.  **Linting/Formatting:** Ensure all code conforms to project's ESLint/Prettier rules.
7.  **Pattern Consistency:** Adhere to established project patterns. Don't introduce new ones without discussion/explicit instruction. If replacing an old pattern, ensure the old implementation is fully removed.
8.  **File Naming:** Use clear, descriptive names. Avoid "temp", "refactored", "improved", etc., in permanent file names.
9.  **No One-Time Scripts:** Do not commit one-time utility scripts into the main codebase.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactoring

1.  **Purposeful Refactoring:** Refactor to improve clarity, reduce duplication, simplify complexity, or adhere to architectural goals.
2.  **Holistic Check:** When refactoring, look for duplicate code, similar components/files, and opportunities for consolidation across the affected area.
3.  **Edit, Don't Copy:** Modify existing files directly. Do not duplicate files and rename them (e.g., `component-v2.tsx`).
4.  **Verify Integrations:** After refactoring, ensure all callers, dependencies, and integration points function correctly. Run relevant tests.


## üîí Security

1.  **Server-Side Authority:** Keep sensitive logic, validation, and data manipulation strictly on the server-side. Use secure API endpoints.
2.  **Input Sanitization/Validation:** Always sanitize and validate user input on the server-side.
3.  **Dependency Awareness:** Be mindful of the security implications of adding or updating dependencies.
4.  **Credentials:** Never hardcode secrets or credentials in the codebase. Use environment variables or a secure secrets management solution.
